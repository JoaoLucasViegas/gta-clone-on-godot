# gta-clone-on-godot
Free roam game prototype using game engine Godot

Right now, is just a woman that walk in a map, don't really have animations or gta things,
this is just a prototype to a project that can be explored by a game-team to be a real gta clone.

I just create this project and my game-dev-team don't used it, so the project is stopped.
